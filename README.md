# Four Card Feature Section

---

## Overview

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Four Card Feature Section challenge](#).  
The goal was to build a responsive four-card layout using a **mobile-first approach**, styled completely with **Tailwind CSS**.

## The Challenge

- Reproduce the provided four-card feature design with precise spacing and colors.
- Ensure the layout adapts for **mobile, tablet, and desktop** screens.
- Arrange cards in a **single column** on mobile, with a **center-stacked two-column layout** on desktop.
- Apply **distinct top border colors** to each card to visually differentiate them.
- Maintain consistent typography using the **Poppins** font family.
- Add a subtle **bottom-only box shadow** to all cards for depth.

## Built With

- **HTML5** – semantic markup for structure.
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling (via CDN).
- **Flexbox** – for responsive card alignment.
- **Google Fonts** – `Poppins` for headings and body text.
- **Custom box-shadow** using Tailwind’s arbitrary value syntax.
